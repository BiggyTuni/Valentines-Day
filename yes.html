                    Sorry this took so long to make my love I hope this wasn’t too anticlimactic I want you to know
                    that I love you so much and I really appreciate all that you do for me this message I’m writing right now isn’t only for Valentine’s Day but for our anniversary I have had so much fun spending these last 2 years with you and I am so happy I met you. you are genuinely the greatest thing to have ever happened to me. (English 50/50)

                    ever since that one Valo match you have been on my mind nonstop I will forever remember every moment we have spent together and never forget it I will always remember how you are the person that has helped me the most with my anxiety through my exams and university and how you always try to find a way to help me when I’m struggling like you do when you help me find work or help me become a better person by motivating me to do things I never actually thought of doing. you have helped me so much by figuring out my emotions and allowed me to talk to you about them and give me the space and comfort that i needed even though I never knew I struggled this much with opening up.

                <p class="p">
                    I know this just seems like a clump of thoughts and the order might not make sense but I promise you this is all I ever think about when I’m thinking of you my thoughts are never organized and they always just scroll through every day I spent with you in Alton Towers or cinema dates or when you come over or even when we spend time with RARDS. you are my everything you are my home my safe space my one and only. I’ll never forget the things that you do for me and I’ll always be confused on how you can keep up with the dumb shit I do and say.

                    This time away from you has genuinely been the most heartwrenching thing i have ever felt, every time i tell you that i am staying for longer not only do I get sadder that i wont be seeing you as soon as i thought but seeing your tears and seeing how sad you get makes me hurt so much more cause i hate making you cry more than anything.
                    the time i spend away from you when i go visit family really makes me realize how much i miss you and how much i love you being around me and how much the things you do mean to me. i may not be able to come over for our anniversary but i want you to know that i still love you no matter what and that i still want to spend time together on the day and when i come back i want to make it up to you how ever you want ill save up for us to go on a nice trip together anything at all that im able to do ill do my best to do it.
